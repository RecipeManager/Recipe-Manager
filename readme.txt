Cooking plugin that goes beyond just managing recipes. It allows the chef to detail the ingredients to be used as their own post type.

Recipes currently default to Full schema.org/Recipe and will work with major SERPS to produce better looking search results for your recipes. Future versions will have options to switch your prefered scheme.

Docs Will be coming soon.
